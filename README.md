## Dataset

The description below and the CIFAKE image dataset are sourced from and available in the repository here: https://github.com/2spi/ai-v-real

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of two categories of images:

<b>REAL images:</b> These images are sourced from the Krizhevsky & Hinton's CIFAR-10 dataset, which is a widely-used benchmark dataset for image classification tasks.<br>

<b>FAKE images:</b> These images were generated using the equivalent of CIFAR-10 with Stable Diffusion version 1.4.

The combined dataset provides a diverse set of real and AI-generated images for training the classification model.
